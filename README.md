<br />

<p>I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft where I work on internal-facing developer tools powered by machine learning. 

I graduated from the University of Virginia where I was interested in the intersection of data and people.  I previously was an intern at Novetta where my work primarily focused on developing new methods for text interpretability and helping customers implement state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in their products. Outside of my work at Novetta, I taught an introductory data science class at HackCville, a Charlottesville non-profit. I have also volunteered with the U.S. Air Force through the X-Force program and am the technical producer for the Global Inquirer podcast. 

Throughout my academic career, my goal was to join organizations that allow me to explore computer science in an interdisciplinary fashion. This diversity allows me to be cognizant of biases when I develop algorithms and analyze data.

On a personal note, I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, I love to run, scuba dive, and volunteer with children in STEM!
