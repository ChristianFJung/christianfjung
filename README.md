I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Virginia, interested in the intersection of data and people. I am currently an intern with the Novetta Machine Learning Center of Excellence where my work primarily focuses on developing new methods for text interpretability. Outside of my work at Novetta, I teach an introductory Data Science class at HackCville, a Charlottesville non-profit. I also volunteer with the U.S. Air Force through the X-Force program and am the technical producer for the Global Inquirer podcast. Throughout my academic career, my goal has been  to join  organizations that  allow me to explore computer science in an interdisciplinary fashion. This diversity will allow me to be cognizant of biases when I develop algorithms and analyze data.

On a personal note, I'm the oldest of 4 siblings, I love to run, scuba dive, and volunteer with children in STEM!
